Abstract/ Summary of project:  
For our project, we created a sudoku alarm clock. The problem we were attempting to solve is waking up tired and continuously pressing snooze on your alarm. In addition, many people use their phones immediately after waking up which is proven to have negative effects on your day. The way you start your day really sets the mood for the rest of the day. To solve this problem, our idea was to create an alarm clock in which users need to engage their brain and complete a puzzle before the alarm turns off. This would help wake up the brain in the morning and be more alert for the whole day. 
To create this project, we used a touch screen to display the puzzle and an LCD to display the alarm clock. Through our project, we tested the functionality ourselves by completing the sudoku in the morning with our own alarms and seeing how this impacted our day. Through this testing, we realized that we needed a smaller sudoku than the regular 9 X 9 because this took too much time to solve. So our final prototype included a 4 X 4 sudoku puzzle that would stop the alarm clock when solved.

Background / Client info: 
The problem we are trying to solve is waking up tired with a groggy brain convincing yourself that you will have enough time to press snooze again. Our target market is anyone who has this problem, but specifically students or people in the workforce who have to be awake and alert early in the morning.  
Design Requirements: 
Puzzle Complexity 
Complex enough to be effective while simple enough to complete right after waking up 
Physical Dimensions
Top part - 6 inches , Bottom Face - 6 inches 
Touchscreen - 2.8 inches 
LCD screen - 3.3 inches
Overview of Design process: 
Our final design consisted of a CAD 3D printed part that holds the rest of our physical components including the touchscreen where the puzzle is displayed as well as the LCD screen where the alarm is set and displayed. Our CAD consisted of two parts, a top and bottom piece that came together to create the base of our alarm clock. We planned for the breadboards and arduinos to be inside of the two 3D printed pieces while the top part has a basin for the touchscreen and the front holds the LCD. There are holes in the part for the wires and one in the front by the alarm for the potentiometer which is how the user inputs the time of the alarm. The code for our project was based on a code we found that displayed a 9 by 9 sudoku so our main coding tasks were to alter this code for a 4 by 4 puzzle and to connect the alarm clock to the sudoku puzzle. 
		Challenges: 
We faced many technical challenges along the way but these each provided learning opportunities for our group. An obvious challenge for us was working through this project online amidst a global pandemic and not always having all of the physical components of the project all in one place. 
 Our code in general was a challenge for us because no one had previous coding knowledge. To get through this, I personally spent many hours just reading through lines of code in order to understand what was happening. We also made multiple consultations with engineers through our school and with our teacher which really helped us learn more about coding. After this, I figured out how to alter the code into a 4 X 4 box and change the positions of the numbers to the new grid. 
Another challenge that I faced through the project was the measurements for the CAD. Many different physical components were supposed to fit into different tiny holes so the tolerance and the specific measurements were very important. We also changed physical components multiple times from one to two screens or from buttons to potentiometer so with each change I had to alter the CAD as well. I took the 3D modeling workshops that the ITLL offers in order to assemble my pieces together and I also scheduled a consultation with Mo who gave me realistic insight to our 3D printing process.

Testing: 
In order to test our design requirements, our group personally tested our products functionality throughout the design process and altered components based on this. We could not test on too many different people due to the global pandemic but we did our best. At the end, we also extended our testing to friends and roommates of group members. Each of us decided that waking up to do the sudoku puzzle left us feeling more awake and alert in the morning compared to a day when we did not wake up to a puzzle. Personally, I also found that I was more productive throughout the whole day when I completed a sudoku puzzle right after waking up. 

Conclusion: 
In conclusion, this project advanced my skills in coding and 3D modeling while also giving me the real experience of the engineering design process. I learned how to code a touchscreen and further understood the arduino coding program. I took workshops that improve my assembly skills in CAD specifically Onshape. Also, I improved my teamwork skills and really enjoyed working with this group because I feel that everyone benefited from each other. Through this project, I also learned to use the resources my school provides which will be very useful in future projects. I specifically learned how to schedule consultations to receive help and how to sign up for skill building workshops.
